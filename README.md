To complete my vocational high school education in computer science, I carried out a final project involving the development of a website targeting restaurants. I focused primarily on the backend, creating a variety of features for the administrator user. This included functionalities such as adding, removing, and editing products, as well as charts that display the restaurant's financial evolution and the most popular dishes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML and CSS
- JavaScript
    - ChartJs 
- MySql
- PHP

## Some Images
Options for the administrator to add, remove, or edit products.
